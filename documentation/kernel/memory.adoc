About
-----
This section describes the memory layouting and management.


Address spaces
--------------
Each <<threads#Processes,process>> has its own address space. All threads of
the same process share the same address space and therefore have access to the
same regions of memory.

[[Userspace]]
User space
----------
The user space is the area of virtual address space that can possibly be
accessed by a user space process. 

The layout of this part of the virtual address space is as follows.

[options="header"]
|===============================================================================
| Adress range				| Description
| 0x00100000 - 0x80000000	| The program executable is loaded in this area.
	Right after the last used page of the process image, the process heap starts
	and may possibly expand up to the end of this area.
| 0x80000000 - 0xA0000000	| _Currently unused_
| 0xA0000000 - 0xC0000000	| "Virtual ranges" area. This area is handled
	by a kind of "range allocator" that manages the address ranges within. These
	address ranges are used for various things: the user space stacks,
	allocating shared memory, thread-local-storage and more.

[[Stacks]]
Stacks
------
Each thread has two stacks: a user space stack and a kernel space stack.

Kernel space stack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The kernel space stack is the one that the kernel operates on during system
calls and where the state of the thread is stored during interruptions. It is
statically assigned to 1 page and mapped into <<Kernelspace,kernel space>>.
It is not accessible by the userspace code.

User space stack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The user space stack is the one that the application operates on. On thread
creation, a virtual address range of 16 pages is reserved and the last page
is mapped as a physical page. The stack starts at the end of this page.

This allows the stack to grow dynamically without reserving more physical
memory than necessary. When the stack overflows, a page fault is triggered
and the kernel handles the situation by inserting a new physical page.
