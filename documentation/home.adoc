Welcome to the documentation of the Ghost OS!

Ghost is an operating system for the Intel x86 platform written with almost
all components written from scratch. The kernel follows a pure microkernel
design. This document contains conceptual and technical documentation about
the system.

NOTE: This file is supposed to be compiled with AsciiDoctor
(http://asciidoctor.org/), see the scripts `generate.sh` and `generate.bat`.

The contents of this documentation are split in sections for each system
component. On the top of each page there's a link back to this home page.

* *Kernel section* contains documentation about the kernel itself.
	** <<threads#,Threads section>> contains everything about processes and threading
