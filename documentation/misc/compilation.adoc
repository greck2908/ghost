= Building from source
:toc: left
include::../common/homelink.adoc[]

Basics
------
This document contains an explanation on how to build the toolchain and then the
entire operating system from it's sources.

The project itself consists of two repositories:

* *ghost*, main repository containing the source code for the system
* *ghost-sysroot*, a blueprint for the system root directory

The system root directory (sysroot) is a concept used in cross compiling. It contains
the initial filesystem that is used to boot the OS. All cross-compiled libraries and
applications are installed in this folder, and when cross-compiling a program or
library, the compiler uses this directory as the location to search for like headers,
libraries and more. This avoids using the host systems header files.


Preparation
-----------

. Clone the ghost-sysroot to `/ghost/sysroot` (If you want to use a different folder, you
	must modify the `TOOLCHAIN_BASE` in the `ghost.sh` script).
. Clone the main repository somewhere to your filesystem (for example `/ghost/source`)


On Mac OS
~~~~~~~~~
If you are on Mac OS X, you must make sure that the GNU GCC is used (it by default has
some kind of alias so that GCC points to LLVM, which we don't want). Use export to set the
correct version:

-----
export CC=gcc-5
export CXX=g++-5
export CPP=cpp-5
export LD=gcc-5
-----


Toolchain setup
---------------
To setup the toolchain, simply run the toolchain setup script `toolchain.sh`. It will
attempt to do everything that is necessary to create the toolchain.


Installing libraries
--------------------
To build the core applications of Ghost, several libraries must be built beforehand.
The core libraries depend on each other, while each of the third party libraries depends of
the core. The libuser builds on top of all these libraries.

In the repository there is a `patches/ports` folder which contains a script usable to easily
install all libraries that the core applications of Ghost require.

Navigate to the folder and install the libraries in this order:

-----
./port.sh zlib/1.2.8
./port.sh pixman/0.32.6
./port.sh libpng/1.6.18
./port.sh freetype/2.5.3
./port.sh cairo/1.12.18
-----


Building core applications
--------------------------
Finally, run `build.sh all` within the `libuser` folder in the repository. This will install
the high-level userspace library that the core applications use.

Now that all the dependencies are ready, the core applications can be built.
Run `build.sh all` in the directory of each program you want to install.

As there is currently no buildscript that automates the process of building the core
applications, it is easiest to import everything in Eclipse. Each project has the necessary
Eclipse settings and can be built simply by clicking the build button.


Tips
~~~~

* To specify a different toolchain base directory, modify `TOOLCHAIN_BASE` in the
	`ghost.sh` file
* While binutils and gcc are being built, the log output is redirected to a file named
	`ghost-build.log` in the respective build directory in the temporary folder
