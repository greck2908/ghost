# ABOUT GHOST
**Ghost** is an operating system for the Intel x86 platform. The project is licensed as GPLv3.
The kernel and the userspace applications are written from scratch in C++ and Assembly (and some C).
The kernel is not based on any existing kernel and partially Unix-compatible.

This is the main development repository.

*Project website:* http://ghostkernel.org/

## Status of redux
With `redux` I started a re-implementation of the kernel which is now present in the `master` branch.
Currently I'm working on rewriting most of the filesystem related calls.
Once a ready-to-run version is there, I will post a live CD on the website.

If you are looking for the previous kernel implementation (versions up to 0.5.6b),
check the legacy branch out.

## Documentation
See the `documentation` folder. It contains information about the technical design as well
as building instructions.
