# ABOUT GHOST
**Ghost** is an operating system for the Intel x86 platform. The project is licensed as GPLv3. It was started as a research project to learn more about low-level software programming and computer internals. This repository is occasionally updated with the new sources.

The kernel and the userspace applications are written from scratch in C++ and Assembly (and some C). The kernel is not based on any existing kernel and not Unix-compatible. There is a relatively small POSIX.1 compatibility layer that allows porting some software to the system though.

The most advanced features are SMP support (symmetric multiprocessing) to run on multiple processors, a v8086 monitor for executing BIOS calls (which also introduced VESA support), support for ELF binary loading (including thread-local-storage and all the other little things), as well as signal support. And there is a fancy little GUI that makes it all good-looking :-)

## Status
