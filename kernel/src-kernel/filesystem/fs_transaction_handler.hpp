/**
 * A transaction handler is a temporary object that accompanies a transaction. It holds temporary values
 * that the (stateless) delegate needs for its operations. A handler is normally passed in two cases:
 *
 * - When something is requested from a delegate, the handler is passed so the delegate can
 *   immediately set the output values and call the finishing function if required
 *
 * - When a {g_waiter_fs_transaction} is notified that a transaction has finished, the delegate calls
 *   the finish function of the handler; the handler then calls the respective finish function of the
 *   delegate, so the delegate can fill the information that was the result of the transaction into
 *   the handler. Then the handler does anything that is further required, like filling a data structure
 *   or calling another function (see {g_fs_transaction_handler_discovery} etc.)
